| [![Travis Status](https://travis-ci.org/theos/theos.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/theos/theos) | [![AppVeyor Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/0y5mguq1j0lkr7vv?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/kirb/theos) |

Theos is tested via [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) to ensure it remains compatible with popular Theos-based projects. An error above doesn’t necessarily mean Theos isn’t working at all on that platform — just that the test suite failed.
