# New Instance Creator
The New Instance Creator (you can call him Nicolas!) is a tool used alongside the [Theos](https://theos.github.io/) build system to generate the boilerplate for a project or subproject. It cna ask questions so it can pre-fill certain details such as the project name. NIC templates are tar archives with a certain structure that NIC can understand. NIC was once integrated in the same Git repo as Theos, but now has been decoupled from Theos to its own repo.

Documentation is available on the [NIC page](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/NIC) of iPhone Dev Wiki.
