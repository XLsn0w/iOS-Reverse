port-archivefetch(1)
====================

NAME
----
port-archivefetch - Fetch archive for the given ports if available.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-vdqypotf*] [*-D* 'portdir'] *archivefetch*
     [['portname' | 'pseudo-portname' | 'port-expressions' | 'port-url']]
     [+/-variant ...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*port archivefetch* attempts to download a binary archive for the given port(s)
from the configured binary sources, by default from 'packages.macports.org' and
its mirrors. An archive or port image is a tarball containing the files of
a port and some metadata and can be used to install a port without building it
from source. See the *PORT IMAGES* section for a description of the port image
concept in MacPorts.

You can choose multiple variants, by specifying +name, which indicates the
variant is desired, or -name, indicating the contrary.

Global variants will be applied as specified in man:variants.conf[5].

*-p*::
    Proceed even if a port fails to fetch. This is useful if you are trying to
    download all available binary images for a number of ports, e.g., if you
    want to install them later without a network connection.
