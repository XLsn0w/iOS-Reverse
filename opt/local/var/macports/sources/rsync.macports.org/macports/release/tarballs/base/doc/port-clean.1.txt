NAME
----
port-clean - Remove temporary files used to build a port.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-vdqypotf*] [*-D* 'portdir'] *clean*
     [--archive] [--dist] [--logs] [--work] [--all]
     [['portname' | 'pseudo-portname' | 'port-expressions' | 'port-url']]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*port clean* removes temporary files that were created while installing a port.

During the installation of a port, a number of files might be placed on your
system. Whether they actually are depends on the installation process (e.g., if
a pre-built binary is available, source code will not be downloaded and
extracted). The temporary files include:

 * Archives of source code, the so-called distfile(s),
 * log files for the build,
 * a working directory for the build MacPorts internal state, and folders
 + used as home and temporary directories,
 * an extracted copy of the source code, and
 * a staging directory for installations.

By default, most of these temporary files are removed after a successful
installation, while others (such as the source code archives) are kept because
they might be re-used later. However, if a build fails, these files are not
deleted, might be re-used later and lead to failure again. It is for this
reason, that the standard approach in case of a build failure in MacPorts is
*clean* and try again.

Which of the temporary files are removed depends on the flags given to clean.
The default behavior is *--work*.

OPTIONS
-------
*--archive*::
    Remove partially downloaded binary archives.

*--dist*::
    Delete source code archives, the so-called distfiles.

*--logs*::
    Delete log files.

*--work*::
    Delete the work directory of a port. This is the default and includes the
    extracted source code, the staging directory and MacPorts' internal progress
    information. This is included in all but *--logs*.

*--all*::
    Remove all temporary files. The same as specifying *--archive*, *--dist*,
    *--logs*, and *--work*.
