NAME
----
pubkeys.conf - public key configuration file of the MacPorts system

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*pubkeys.conf* is the configuration file used by the MacPorts system to locate
the public keys used to verify the integrity and authenticity of

- the tree of port definitions,
- downloaded pre-built binary archives, and
- MacPorts updates.

The file is read by the *port* command. Lines beginning with '#' are comments,
empty lines are ignored. All other lines must contain absolute paths of
PEM-encoded RSA public keys for use by OpenSSL.

MacPorts comes pre-configured with its official public key. The authenticity of
the public key file is provided by the MacPorts installer, which is
cryptographically signed with an Apple Developer ID of one of the MacPorts
developers. Unless you want to provide your own separate ports tree or your own
pre-built binary archives, there is no need to modify the *pubkeys.conf* file.

FILES
-----
$\{prefix\}/etc/macports/pubkeys.conf::
    Standard system-wide MacPorts public key configuration file.

User-specific configuration of public keys is not supported.
