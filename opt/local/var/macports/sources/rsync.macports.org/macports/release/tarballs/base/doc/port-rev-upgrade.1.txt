port-rev-upgrade(1)
===================

NAME
----
port-rev-upgrade - Check for linking inconsistencies and attempt to fix them
automatically.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-vdy*] *rev-upgrade*
     [--id-loadcmd-check]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*port rev-upgrade* will check all binaries (i.e., executables and libraries)
installed by MacPorts for consistency. If any linking problems such as missing
or incompatible libraries are found, *rev-upgrade* will rebuild broken ports in
an attempt to fix the problems.

By default, *rev-upgrade* is run automatically after each installation or
upgrade, unless you pass the *--no-rev-upgrade* option or disable this beahvior
in man:macports.conf[5] using the *revupgrade_autorun* switch.


OPTIONS
-------

*--id-loadcmd-check*::
    Check the ID load command in each library installed by MacPorts. This load
    command contains a path that should always reference the library itself,
    because the path will be copied into all binaries and libraries that link
    against this library. This option verifies that this is the case and will
    detect incorrect or non-absolute paths. Since this check is only helpful for
    port maintainers, it is disabled by default.
