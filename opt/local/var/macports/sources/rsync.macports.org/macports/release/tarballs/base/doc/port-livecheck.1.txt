NAME
----
port-livecheck - Check if a new version of the software is available

SYNOPSIS
--------
[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-vd*] [*-D* 'portdir'] *livecheck*
     [['portname' | 'pseudo-portname' | 'port-expressions' | 'port-url']]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*port livecheck* checks whether a newer version of a given port is available
upstream. It (usually) does that by automatically downloading a web page and
applying a regular expression that extracts a version number. If the version
number is different from the one the port packages, a message is printed.

*port livecheck* is useful for maintainers that want to check whether new
versions of their ports are available so they can be updated. It can also be
used by users that encounter a problem, because updating to the latest upstream
version is generally one of the first steps in case of an error or when
encountering a bug.
