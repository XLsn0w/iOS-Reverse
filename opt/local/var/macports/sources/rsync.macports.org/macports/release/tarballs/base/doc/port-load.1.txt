NAME
----
port-load, port-unload, port-reload - Control daemons installed by a port

SYNOPSIS
--------
[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-d*] [*-D* 'portdir'] [*load* | *unload* | *reload*]
     [['portname' | 'pseudo-portname' | 'port-expressions' | 'port-url']]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
These commands control the daemons that are installed by some of the ports. If
a port provides daemon functionality, a note will be printed during installation
advising you how to use it.

The daemon functionality is provided by installing a man:launchd[8]
configuration file (see man:launchd.conf[5]) and calling man:launchctl[1] on
your behalf. *port load* advises launchd to start the daemon defined by a port's
configuration file, also called a ``startup item''. Once loaded, launchd will
preserve this state - even across reboots - until the daemon is unloaded using
*port unload*. If you want to restart a daemon, you can use *port reload*, which
is a convenience wrapper around *port unload* followed by a short delay and
*port load*.
