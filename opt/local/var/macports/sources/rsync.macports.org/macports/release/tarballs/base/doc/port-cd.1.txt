port-cd(1)
==========

NAME
----
port-cd - Change the current working directory in shell mode.

SYNOPSIS
--------
To be used only in shell mode:

[cmdsynopsis]
*cd*
    ['portname' | 'pseudo-portname' | 'port-expressions' | 'port-url']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*cd* can be used when *port* is running in shell mode (see
man:port-shell[7]) to change the current working directory to the directory
that contains a given port. The second parameter is not optional, as it
usually is with *cd* in your shell.

BUGS
----
*port cd* can be used from the command line, but is a no-op.

SEE ALSO
--------
