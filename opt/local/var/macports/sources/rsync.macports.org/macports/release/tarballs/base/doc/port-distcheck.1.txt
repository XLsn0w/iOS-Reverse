NAME
----
port-distcheck - Check if a port can be fetched from all of its mirrors

SYNOPSIS
--------
[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-qvdy*] [*-D* 'portdir'] *distcheck*
     [['portname' | 'pseudo-portname' | 'port-expressions' | 'port-url']]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*port distcheck* downloads all source files for a given port from all available
mirrors (including MacPorts' mirror infrastructure) and checks that the
modification date of the file on the mirror is not more recent than the
modification date of the 'Portfile'.

Distcheck can be switched to verify the file size of the downloaded files
instead by setting the 'distcheck.type' option to 'filesize' in the 'Portfile'
for the tested port.

BUGS
----
*port distcheck* should not rely on timestamps or file sizes but use the
checksums available in the 'Portfile' to verify the integrity of the files on
the mirrors instead. See man:port-checksum[1].

Meanwhile, you can use source:macports-contrib/blob/master/mirror-utils/port-checkmirrors[port-checkmirrors] from
contrib to do that.
