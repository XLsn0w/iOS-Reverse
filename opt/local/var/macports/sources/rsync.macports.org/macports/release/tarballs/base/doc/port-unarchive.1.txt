port-unarchive - Extract the destroot of the given ports from a binary archive

SYNOPSIS
--------
[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-vdtoy*] [*-D* 'portdir'] *unarchive*
     [['portname' | 'pseudo-portname' | 'port-expressions' | 'port-url']]
     [+/- variant ...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Extract the destroot (i.e. the set of files that are installed by a port) from
installed or downloaded binary archives. Usually, users will not have to run
this command manually. It is run automatically by MacPorts when installing
a port from a pre-built binary. The possibility to execute it directly exists
for debugging purposes.
