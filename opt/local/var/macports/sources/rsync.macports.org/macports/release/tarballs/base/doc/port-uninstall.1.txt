NAME
----
port-uninstall - Remove a previously installed port

SYNOPSIS
--------
[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-vdquxpf*] [*-D* 'portdir'] *uninstall*
     [--follow-dependents] [--follow-dependencies] [--no-exec]
     [['portname' | 'pseudo-portname' | 'port-expressions' | 'port-url']]
     [@version]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*port uninstall* removes a port from your system. You can only uninstall a port
if all dependents have been removed before or by applying force with *-f*.
    
If multiple versions of the same port are installed, you need to specify a
version using the *@version* syntax. Use *port installed* to find out
which versions are currently installed on your system. If multiple versions are
installed and you did not specify a version, *port* will output a list.

OPTIONS
-------

*--follow-dependents*::
    Also uninstall all ports recursively depending directly or indirectly on one
    of the specified ports before uninstalling the port itself.

*--follow-dependencies*::
    Also recursively uninstall all ports that the specified port depends on.
    This will not uninstall dependencies that are marked as requested or that
    have other dependents.

*--no-exec*::
    Do not execute any stored pre- or post-uninstall procedures.
