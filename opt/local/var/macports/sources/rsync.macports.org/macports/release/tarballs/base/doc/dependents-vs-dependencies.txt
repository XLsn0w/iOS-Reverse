DEPENDENCY RELATIONS
--------------------

Do not confuse 'dependents' and 'dependencies' (or, shortened, 'deps').
Refer to the following example to understand the difference:

----
portA --> portB
----

*portA* depends on *portB*, i.e., *portA* needs *portB* to run. Because of
that, *portB* is a 'dependency' (or 'dep') of *portA*. After installing
*portA*, *portB* has been automatically installed. At this point, *portA* has
become a 'dependent' of *portB*. You can only uninstall *portB* once all of its
dependents (i.e., including *portA*) have been uninstalled.
