DESCRIPTION
-----------
MacPorts keeps records indicating whether you installed a port manually, or
whether it was pulled in as a dependency of another port. This flag is called
'requested' and is usually automatically set for all ports you list after *port
install* when installing. You can disable this automatic behavior by passing the
*--unrequested* flag to *port install*. See man:port-install[1] for more
information.

*port setrequested* and *port unsetrequested* allow you to manipulate the
requested flag of a port manually. *port setunrequested* is an alias of *port
unsetrequested*.

The requested flag is used to expand the 'leaves' pseudo-portname, i.e. the list
of ports that were automatically installed and are no longer needed. See
man:port[1] for more information on pseudo-portnames.
