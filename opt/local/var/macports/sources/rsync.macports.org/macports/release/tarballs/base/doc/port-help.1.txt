NAME
----
port-help - Get help on MacPorts commands

SYNOPSIS
--------
[cmdsynopsis]
*port* *help* ['action' | 'help-topic']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*port help* opens the manpage for a given port action such as 'install',
'upgrade', 'selfupdate', etc. or a specific help topic like 'macports.conf'.
MacPorts even has help for its help feature. MacPorts will however not engage in
higher level abstractions: There is no help on the help on the help.
