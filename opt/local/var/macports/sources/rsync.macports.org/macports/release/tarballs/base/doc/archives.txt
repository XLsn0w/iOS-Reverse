PORT IMAGES
-----------

MacPorts has the ability to install multiple versions or different variant
selections of the same port. The files will be stored in an intermediate
location as 'archives', which allows to switch between the versions. Only one
version can be active at a time. On activation, files will be copied to their
intended place in 'prefix'.

More information on this topic can be found in the
guide:internals.images[The MacPorts Guide].

To check the current status of a specific port, use *man:port-installed[1]*.
